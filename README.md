# UnityTerminal
A version of Unity Hub that can be operated via the Terminal.

## Why?
Why not?

## How?

Unity supports using command-line agruments when starting the program. All this program does is set the correct flags based on what you typed in.

## I'm in, how do I use this? (Repo Version)

Step 1: Install Unity in the DEFAULT SYSTEM PATH. This script assumes all versions of Unity are installed in the default location. It is currently hard-coded for this, but there could be dragons and all that.

Step 2: Install Python. (You should have this already tbh, very handy language. If you don't, you can get it at https://www.python.org/)

Step 3: Add where you store you project folders to myGitFolders.txt (I included my git folders inside the repo version for reference.)

*Note: This is not required, this is just helpful if you are actually going to use this.*

Step 4: Run the .py program. If you are a smart cookie, you can use auto-py-to-exe to make it a .exe file.


## I'm in, how do I use this? (Pre-Compiled .exe Version)

Step 1: Install Unity in the DEFAULT SYSTEM PATH. This script assumes all versions of Unity are installed in the default location. If you aren't using the repo version, you can't change it currently.

Step 2: Download the lastest release. (Release here: )

Step 3: Run and Profit.
